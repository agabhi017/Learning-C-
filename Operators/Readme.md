# Operators 

### `sizeof`
* As the name suggests, the sizeof operator returns the size of a variable type aka data type or a variable itself in number of bytes. For instance sizeof(int) returns 4 as the output.
* It can be used both with the standard and user-defined data types as well as variables/objects.
* While using the sizeof operator with a data type, parenthesis are required and the syntax is `sizeof(className)`
* Whereas, to retrieve the size of an object, the parenthesis are optional and the syntax could be `sizeof objectName`
