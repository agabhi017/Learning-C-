* The library files contain the compiled code for the functions, whereas the header files contain the prototypes.
* C++ library functions are stored in library files. When the compiler compiles a program, it must search the library files for the functions you’ve used. Compilers differ on which library
files they search automatically.
* Compilers like to add an underscore prefix to function names—another subtle reminder that they have the last say about your program.
