### ___Names of Variables___

* The only characters you can use in names are alphabetic characters, numeric digits, and the underscore (_) character.
* The first character in a name cannot be a numeric digit.
* Uppercase characters are considered distinct from lowercase characters.
* You can’t use a C++ keyword for a name.
* Names beginning with two underscore characters or with an underscore character followed by an uppercase letter are reserved for use by the implementation—that is, 
the compiler and the resources it uses. Names beginning with a single underscore character are reserved for use as global identifiers by the implementation.
* C++ places no limits on the length of a name, and all characters in a name are significant. However, some platforms might have their own length limits.
