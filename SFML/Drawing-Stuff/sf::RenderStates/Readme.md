## `sf::RenderStates`

* Used for setting the states/attributes to drawing objects. These states are :
  * Blend mode: how pixels of the object blend with the background
  * Tranform: rotation/scale/position of the object
  * Texture: the texture of the shape/object
  * Shader: custom graphic effects
* Has a default set of states and most high level objects can be drawn without much manipulation
